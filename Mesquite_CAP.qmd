# Multivariate Analysis - Constrained Analysis

```{r}
##  Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggordiplots)
```

```{r}
# Read in BeeFlat data
Mesquite <-read.csv("Mesquite_AllData.csv")

```

```{r}
MesquiteDiff <- Mesquite %>%
    filter(
        (Site.x == 1)| 
        (Site.x == 5)
      )
```

### NMDS (non-metric dimensional scaling) is an unconstrained analysis

Function `metaMDS()` requires numeric data only.

```{r}
# reduce our matrix to include only the community data, no reference columns
numericonly <- MesquiteDiff |> select(Resprouting, CrownSizeShape, CrownFoliarDensity, DeadBranches)

# Run the NMDS function
mydata.mds <- metaMDS(numericonly, distance="bray", k=2, autotransform=FALSE, noshare = FALSE)
# stress < 0.2 which means NMDS represents the variation well

```

#### Basic plots of NMDS

```{r}
plot(mydata.mds,type="t",display=c("species"))
```

```{r}
plot(mydata.mds,type="t",display=c("sites"))
```

```{r}
plot1 <- ordiplot(mydata.mds, choices=c(1,2)) #sites are circles, + are species
```

#### Making a better plot

Adding species vectors to the plot of sites

```{r}
# mydata.mds was the output of our NMDS above
# envfit is a function that creates vectors for how the different environmental factors (in this case, species) correlate with the NMDS result
# gg_envfit is the ggplot equivalent

#ZeroYr.sspfit <- envfit(mydata.mds, numericonly, permutations = 999)

MesquiteDiff.sspfit <- gg_envfit(mydata.mds, numericonly)


```

```{r}
# brackets make these lines run together - needs to for the plots to overlay
{
ordiplot(mydata.mds, display = "sites", main = "Unconstrained ordination at Year 0")
plot(MesquiteDiff.sspfit, p.max = 0.01, col = "black", cex = 0.7)
 } # change the significance level of species shown with p.max

MesquiteDiff.sspfit$plot 
```
